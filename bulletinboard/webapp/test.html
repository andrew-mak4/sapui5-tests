	<h1>Bulletin Board</h1>
	<p>In this sample app for the testing tutorial we will test application functionality with QUnit, OPA5, and the mock server</p>

	<h2>Entry points</h2>
	<p>Can be used to run the app or the automated tests as needed:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="test/mockServer.html">mockServer.html</a> - start the app with mock data</li>
		<li><a href="test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html">unit/unitTests.qunit.html</a> - run all unit tests</li>
		<li><a href="test/integration/opaTests.qunit.html">integration/opaTests.qunit.html</a> - run all integration tests</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For more documentation please read the <a href="https://sdk.openui5.org">UI5 Developer Guide</a>.</p>
	<p>This page provides a list of entry points for the app so that you do not have to enter the URLs manually.
		From this page you can open the app with mock data, run the unit tests, run the integration tests, or run the appâ€™s test suite.
		Note that in a productive scenario we would have an additional entry point that calls the app with a real service. At this stage we are working with mock data and don't have a real service for our prototype yet, so we have left this step out.

		<b>Home Page</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		The home page of our bulletin board app is the <code>/test/mockServer.html</code> file.<br> On this page, we initialize SAPUI5, start the mock server, and instantiate our app component. It consists of a single view that displays a list of posts from a bulletin board with several attributes in a table.
